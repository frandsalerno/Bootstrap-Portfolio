# My portfolio made with Bootstrap

## Description
My personal portfolio, handcrafted using HTML amd CSS, using bootstrap as the main framework for the CSS. It contains some projects I worked as a Programme Manager and Developer, and some challenges I will be updating from the Trilogyâ€™s Skills Bootcamp Front-End Web Development Programme I've started in October 2022. This is a work in progress and will be updated throughout the following months.
